# DataChat

DataChat is a super simple bare bones discord plugin for spigot / paper. Great if you just want to communicate through discord or want some simple code to build your own plugin using.

Plugin features... 
 - sends messages between a server and a discord channel "general"
 - player join and leave msgs
 - discord command /list (displays in game players)
 - "[Discord]" prefix, when clicked opens a url (you can set this to your disc server invite in the config) 
 - executes messages set from the disc channel id from the config "console"

Coming soon
 - Console output in disc console channel

## How to use

 1. Place the jar in your plugins folder 
 2. Run the server, the plugin will create a folder with a config inside
 3. Stop the server, enter your bot token and channel id's in the config. <br />
  When entering data in the config put it inside quotes like this <br />
  `token: 'blahblahmynameacheff'` <br />
  `general: '4206969420'`
 5. Restart the server ;p
